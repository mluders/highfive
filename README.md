# Context
I built this in one day (for the annual AppFolio Hackathon). I wanted to learn more about the WebSocket protocol.

The physics simulations are built with [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/), and are local to each client. The only data that's sent between clients is their mouse positions.
